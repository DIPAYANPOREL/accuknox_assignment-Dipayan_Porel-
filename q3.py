# Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller, which means if the transaction is rolled back, 
# the signal's changes are also rolled back.

# code snippet
def user_saved(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating long task
    print("Signal finished")

def create_user():
    print("Before user creation")
    User.objects.create(username="testuser")
    print("After user creation")

# If we run the above code in django the create_user function will be executed in the main thread of the django application.
# and here is the output of the code

# Before user creation
# Signal received
# Signal finished
# After user creation

# From the above output we can say that the signal is executed in the same database transaction as the caller by default.

# Here's an easy code snippet to demonstrate that Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller:

from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_saved(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal: Creating related profile for user {instance.username}")
    Profile.objects.create(user=instance, bio="Default bio")

@transaction.atomic
def create_user_with_profile():
    print("Starting user creation")
    user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
    print("User created, intentionally raising an exception")
    raise Exception("Simulated error")

# Usage:
try:
    create_user_with_profile()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Caught exception: {e}")

# Check if user and profile were created:
user_exists = User.objects.filter(username="testuser").exists()
profile_exists = Profile.objects.filter(user__username="testuser").exists()
print(f"User exists: {user_exists}")
print(f"Profile exists: {profile_exists}")

# Output:
# Starting user creation
# Signal: Creating related profile for user testuser
# User created, intentionally raising an exception
# Caught exception: Simulated error
# User exists: False
# Profile exists: False

# This show us when the transaction is rolled back due to the exception,
# both the user creation and the signal-triggered profile creation are undone.
